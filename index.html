       <h3 id="first">Air pollution</h3>
       <p>Air pollution is everywhere and it is growing every day! Living in fresh and clean air is the right of every human being, but unfortunately, getting the same has become so difficult today! Let’s find out what exactly air pollution is and how it can be prevented.</p>

      <p>Air pollution can also be described as the variation of air due to any physical, chemical or biological modification which leads to adverse effects on environment and humans.</p>
      <p>Air pollution is nothing but the presence of various gases and particles in an unsuitable and dangerous proportionate that intimidate environment, flora and fauna.</p>
      <p>Effect on Environment and Atmosphere:Depleting ozone layer,Global warming,Acid Rain,Harmful effects of smog.</p>
      <p>Solutions for Air Pollution:Use renewable energy,Protect forests and grow more tress,Solar energy based equipment,Share vehicles,Introduce cycle culture for short distance travel,Use of electric, hybrid and energy efficient vehicles, Proper vehicle maintenance,Clean and Efficient garbage disposable system,Say no to plastic.</p>

     <h3 id="second">Water pollution</h3>
     <p>Water covers two-thirds of the Earth’s surface, with over 97% present in the oceans and less than 1% in freshwater streams and lakes. Water is also present in the atmosphere in solid form in the polar icecaps and as groundwater in aquifers (water-bearing rocks) deep underground.</p>

     <p>Water pollution may be defined as any chemical or physical change in water detrimental to living organisms. It can occur through natural processes, for example by sediments produced by natural erosion. Water bodies are a major recipient of an extensive array of wastes produced by human activity. These may be discharged directly into watercourses by sewers or pipes from factories or be washed down from agricultural or urban areas particularly after heavy rains. Under rather exceptional circumstances, water bodies may become significantly contaminated by the atmospheric deposition of pollutants.</p>
     <p>Water pollution is a global problem and one that does not respect national boundaries. Sources of pollution may be domestic, agricultural or industrial. In less-developed countries, human and animal waste and sediments from unsound agricultural and forestry practices are the main pollutants. In more-developed countries; industrial pollutants, such as toxic metals, organic Chemicals and heat add to the water pollution problem. The effectiveness of treating wastes prior to their release into the environment determines the balance between potential and actual pollution.</p>
     <p>Preventive Measures:Industries should not be allowed to discharge untreated chemicals into the water bodies.</p>
     <p>Drinking water should be properly treated to make it free from any germs.</p>
     <p>The sewage system should be much more scientific.</p>
     <p>The waste water should be purified before it goes to the river.</p>
     <p>The toxic chemicals from industries should be properly treated prior to discharge into the environment</p>

     <h3 id="third">Noise pollution</h3>
     <p>Noise pollution is an unwanted or disturbing sound which can interfere with normal activities for humans and wildlife, such as sleeping, conversation, reproduction, communication, or disrupt or diminish one's quality of life. Noise pollution can come from many sources, such as automobiles, motorcycles, aircraft, ships, trucks, buses, jet planes, construction equipment, electrical machinery, lawn mowers and leaf blowers, to name a few. Excessive noise pollution, from the city streets to the oceans' commercial shipping traffic, can have harmful effects on the humans, plants, animals, trees and marine life constantly exposed to it. Long-term exposure to traffic noise may lead to coronary heart disease.</p>

     <p>There are various types of noise that can effect us. Noise transmission through walls within a home, noises from outside like air or street traffic and noise that is in the form of vibration,often from mechanical equipment.</p>
     <p>Noise pollution affects both health and behavior. Unwanted sound (noise) can damage psychological health. Noise pollution can cause hypertension, high stress levels, tinnitus, hearing loss, sleep disturbances, and other harmful effects.</p>
     <p>Traffic is the main source of noise pollution in the cities.</p>
     <p>Noise can have a detrimental effect on wild animals, increasing the risk of death by changing the delicate balance in predator or prey detection and avoidance, and interfering the use of the sounds in communication, especially in relation to reproduction and in navigation. Acoustic overexposure can lead to temporary or permanent loss of hearing.</p>
     <p>Prevent-Noise-Pollution:Sound-proof your space, Keep noisy machines away from your bedroom and living areas, Spend time away from noise, Learn to meditate.</p>
